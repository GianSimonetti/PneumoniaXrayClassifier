# PneumoniaXrayClassifier
This project develops an AI model to classify chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection. It uses deep learning techniques and is trained on a dataset of X-ray images. The goal is to train a model that can distinguish between X-rays of healthy patients and those with pneumonia.
